# smartlyPCB
This project is a business card from the company SmartLy - Dispositivos Inteligentes. It contains all the contact information and the QR code that takes you to the website. In addition, a rule and a didactic circuit are available for making a traffic light using few components and easy recording. The entire process of creating this PCB was simple thanks to EasyEDA.com, with its fast system for creating components and ease of development on the platform. EasyEDA.com is a website that works as a PCB design tool, all thanks to JLCPCB.com that it developed thinking to optimize the work of designers from all over the world, so JLCPCB.com is not only the best company for the manufacture of PCBs as well as the one that is most concerned with helping and optimizing the work of its customers.
